# Contributing to Ourz

Ourz wouldn't exist without the Open Source community at large.
We welcome contributions. Contributors will be included in something.. unique... more to come.

## Developing

The development branch is `dev`, and this is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. Currently there are no tests setup for the repository.
That would probably be the single most impactful contribution to make currently.
Only after sufficient manual testing of the Vercel Preview Deployment, can changes be merged to `main`.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your
   local device.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b my-branch-name
   ```
3. Install the dependencies with:
   ```
   npm i
   ```
4. Start developing and watch for code changes:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Building

At the very least, make sure you can mint and create a new split on rinkeby.
